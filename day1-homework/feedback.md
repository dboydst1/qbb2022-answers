In exercise one, I'm not sure I entirely follow your explanation for why we see the substitution patterns that we do. You should see that purines get subbed for each other more often than with pyrimidines. The reverse is also true.

In exercise 2, your code is correct as are your answers. It would be good to discuss a little more about your choice of "promoter" states, as this is a somewhat subjective descision by necessity.

Exercise 3 - Nice job, good explanations and correct code.

Exercise 4 - The grep option -v means include only lines that don't contain the search term. The -f option means take all search terms found in the file following the -f. So, grep is only returning gene names that appear in the H3K27ac file but do not appear in the H3K9me3 file.

Nice work on this assignment. You seem to be doing well both with awk and bedtools. Keep up the good work!
