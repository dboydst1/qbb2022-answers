 # Question 1.1
 # 1Mbp * 5 = 5Mbp; 5Mbp / 100 bp = 50,000
 # 1Mbp * 15 = 15Mbp; 15Mbp / 100 bp = 150,000
 
 # Question 1.3
 # In my randomly generated run, 6617 bases had 0x coverage. The poisson distribution predicts 6808 bases to have 0x coverage. In this case, the actual coverage was slightly better than what the poisson distribution predicts.
 
 # Question 1.4
 # In this run, the genome had 25 bases with 0x coverage, where the poisson distribution predicted no bases with 0x coverage. In this case, the actual coverage was slightly worse than what the poisson distribution predicts.
