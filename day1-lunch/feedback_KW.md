## Feedback for day1-lunch from KW

### Exercise 2

* b (Mean): Very good.

* c (Median): Yes, that would be the way to find the median. Did you have enough info to do that given the available files or would you have needed different files?

### Exercise 3

* b (Tally): Good work

* c (Fraction): Good reasoning

### Exercise 4

* b (Tally): Very nice

* c (All super populations): fantastic reasoning ; if you wanted to drop the `grep AFR`, you could instead sort by the final column and just print all the info sorted

### Exercise 5

* b (HG00100.vcf): Good file making. You perhaps should include column 9 for the format information as well, so `cut -f 1-9, 13 random_snippet.vcf > HG100100.vcf`

* c (genotypes): Very good

* d (AF): Nice use of `grep`, but neither `sort` or `cut` were necessary

* e (AFR_AF): Good reasoning

Estimated Completion: 100%
