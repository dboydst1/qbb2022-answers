## Exercise 1

great wrangling of the data files

## Exercise 2, questions 1-2

fantastic job reading in the data and making well labeled plots!

I would suggest considering switching the axes that you use for the scatter plots. If you know that you're going to do a linear regression for those two variables, you may want the variables and the plot's slope to reflect the relationship you use in the regression equation. (optional)

## Exercise 2, question 3 size of relationship

You have the right idea for this, but consider which of your variables is the independent variable and which is the response (aka dependent variable) and reword and the size of the relationship to reflect this (please correct)

## Exercise 2, question 4 size of relationship

Again, you have the right idea for this, but consider which of your variables is the independent variable and which is the response (aka dependent variable) and reword and the size of the relationship to reflect this (please correct)

## Exercise 2, question 5

another well labeled, great plot

## Exercise 2, question 6

Good work

## Exercise 2, question 7

Yes, great job predicting!
