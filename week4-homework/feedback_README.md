Really really awesome work. One small thing: we're missing the plink command you used to generate allele frequencies (-0.25)

Also, for some reason, the plots you uploaded are blank, but I ran your plotting code, and the plots I got look correct, so you're good to go. In the future, just try to make sure that the plots upload correctly (no points deducted)

One last thing: please don't put your python code in your README; it's enough just to put in your README that your ran your plotting script. When you put the python code in the README, it's really hard for us (and I assume also you) to find the rest of your commands, and responses. This is by no means a big deal, it'll just make grading easier for us in the future.
